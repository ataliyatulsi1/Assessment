ASSESSMENT 1

1) Import pandas and read in the banklist.csv file into a dataframe called banks.
Code:- 
import pandas as pd
data =pd.read_csv('banklist.csv')
print(data)

2) Show the head of the dataframe.
Code:-  
import pandas as pd
data =pd.read_csv('banklist.csv')
print(data.head())

3) What are the column names?
Code:- 
import pandas as pd
data =pd.read_csv('banklist.csv')
print(data.columns)

4) How many States (ST) are represented in this data set?
Code:- 
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("banklist.csv")
print(banks["ST"].nunique())

5) Get a list or array of all the states in the data set.
Code:-
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("banklist.csv")
data = banks["ST"].unique()
print(data)

6) What are the top 5 states with the most failed banks?
Code:-
import pandas as pd
failed_banks_count = banks.groupby('ST').size()
sorted_faile = failed_banks_count.sort_values(ascending=False)
top_5_states = sorted_failed_banks.head(5)
print(top_5_states)
